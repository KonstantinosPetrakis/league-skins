# League Skins

A Windows skin changer for League of Legends based on lol-skins and cslol-manager.

## How it works

- It downloads the latest skins from [lol-skins](https://github.com/darkseal-org/lol-skins) and unzips them.
- It downloads, unzips and uses [cslol-manager](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager) to change the skins in the game.
- It uses [Community Data Dragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/) to get the latest skin metadata.

## Build it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KonstantinosPetrakis/league-skins.git
cd league-skins
npm install
npm run build:win
```
